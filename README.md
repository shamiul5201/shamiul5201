### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Shamiul Islam

Iâ€™m exploring AI after completing my **BSc in Computing** from the **University of Greenwich**, focusing on image processing, deep learning, and computer vision. My core strengths include **Python**, **TensorFlow**, and **CNNs**, as well as **face recognition** and **image segmentation**. Currently, Iâ€™m working on **OCR**, **object detection**, and **pose estimation**, with plans to dive into **diffusion models** and **generative AI** soon.
